<h1>The Ozone Layer</h1>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The ozone layer is a region in the stratosphere which protects the earth from very dangerous UV (Ultraviolet rays). The ozone layer is made of a very special gas called Ozone. The Ozone gas has three Oxygen atoms in it and it is a very reactive gas. This layer absorbs a part of the sunâ€™s radiation which prevents it from reaching the earth's surface.</p>
<p><strong>Importance:</strong> For pollution and some other reasons, this layer can be depleted. We have seen that from time to time, because of this depletion, massive holes are created in this layer, which is very dangerous for us. Depletion in this layer can cause a high presence of UV rays on earth's surface. This increases the chance of skin cancer among people who have a lack of melanin in their skin. UV rays are dangerous for our cells. It hampers birth and cell growth. In many cases, it can destroy cells. It also hampers reproduction strength among living beings. It can also damage nails and hair. Moreover, UV rays can damage crops and plants. As a result of this ray, leaves can be smaller and yellowish, which can cause a disease called Chorosis. It can hamper the strength of seed, which can cause more attacks by insects and diseases on crops and plants. It can also hamper the reproduction of crops and plants. Microorganisms, seaweeds and plankton can be destroyed because of UV rays. Because of this ray, growth of crops and plants will be hampered, which can lead to food shortage and global warming. It will destroy geodiversity. It will also increase the rate of acid rain.<p>
<p><strong>Steps to save Ozone Layer:</strong> Now it is very clear to us how important the Ozone layer is for us and we have to prevent the depletion which is mostly caused by us humans. To protect this Ozone layer we have to prevent the use of greenhouse gases like Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gas, Halogenated hydrocarbon, Methyl Bromide and Nitrous Oxide. We also have to prevent the emission of Carbon Dioxide (CO3) gas. We can use fewer air conditioners (ACs). Because if the air conditioners are not maintained properly it can release a lot of greenhouse gases in the air. We have to prevent the use of some products like air fresheners and hair sprays which contain a lot of Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases. We have to use more organic pesticides rather than using chemical pesticides. Because in the production of chemical pesticides a lot of greenhouse gases are released. Countries like America, China, Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom produce most of the carbon dioxide in the world. These countries should reduce the emission of Carbon Dioxides. Renewable energy sources like solar power, wind power, water power can be used to prevent the emission of CO2.</p>
<p><strong>Conclution:</strong> To conclude, we can say that ozone layer is a very important part of human life. So we should do everything to save it.<p>
